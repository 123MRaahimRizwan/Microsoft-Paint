# Microsoft Paint
Here is a project made with the idea of Microsoft Paint. It is a fully functional editor with different colours and clear functionality.

## Description
In this repository there is the main python file `main.py` which has all the logic of the game and there is a `utils` folder which contains all the utility files of the game. Inside the utils folder there are a bunch of files named `__init__.py`, `button.py`,`settings.py`. The `__init__.py` file containes the code to initialize pygame. The `button.py` file contains the button class which makes all the buttons in the game. `The settings.py` file contains the code to control the game. Just ignore the `__pycache__` folder but don't **delete** it.

## Installation 
You can install pygame by writing `pip install pygame` in your terminal.
